## Risk Probability and Impact Definitions

### Probability Scale
- **High (70-100%)**: Very likely to occur
- **Medium (30-70%)**: Moderate chance of occurring
- **Low (0-30%)**: Unlikely to occur

### Impact Scale
- **Critical**: Project failure or major security breach
- **High**: Significant delay (>1 week) or major feature loss
- **Medium**: Moderate delay (<1 week) or quality degradation
- **Low**: Minor inconvenience or easily resolved

### Risk Score Calculation
**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**
- **High Risk (7-10)**: Immediate action required
- **Medium Risk (4-6.9)**: Monitor and prepare mitigation
- **Low Risk (0-3.9)**: Track but no immediate action needed

## Risk Response Strategies

| Strategy Type | Description | When to Use | Examples from Project |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Avoid** | Eliminate the risk entirely by changing plans | High impact, controllable risks | Not using experimental technologies |
| **Mitigate** | Reduce probability or impact | Most medium/high risks | Adding indexes for performance; early testing |
| **Transfer** | Shift risk to third party | External dependencies | Using managed services (Supabase, Railway) |
| **Accept** | Acknowledge risk and prepare contingency | Low impact or unavoidable risks | Potential third-party downtime |

## Risk Monitoring Plan

### Weekly Risk Review Checklist
- [ ] Review all high-priority risks
- [ ] Update risk status based on project progress
- [ ] Identify any new risks
- [ ] Verify mitigation strategies are working
- [ ] Adjust contingency plans if needed
- [ ] Communicate risk status to team

### Risk Escalation Criteria
**Escalate if:**
- Any high-priority risk materializes
- Medium risk shows signs of becoming high risk
- New critical risk identified
- Contingency plan needs to be activated
- Timeline impact > 2 days
