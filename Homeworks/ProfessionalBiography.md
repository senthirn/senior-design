## Project Overview

I am looked for an engaging project that allows me to solve a current problem in the world. Whether that be to make an existing process easier, or solving a problem for those who never knew it was a problem. Either way, I want to make something that can make the world an easier and better place to live. I am also looking to incorporate AI into my vision as a society, we are treading towards using more of an agentic workflow, and I would like to be at the forefront of it.
